-  We can do function from shell.py like insert files from computer fileSystem to our fileSystem , create folder, create user , swicth user , copy/move/remove files ,change permission 


    
## Instructions
- Make sure you install all dependencies from requirments.txt
- Run create_table.py  for database , tables and root user creation 
- Run shell.py (example : python3 shell.py) for user interation like type commands as per your requirements ( example: ls -la  or mkdir test)
- OR if you need to walkthrough , please run python3 walkthrough.py which will run some listed command and you can see work flow.
